# Inserting Strategies in Node.js

Welcome to the **Inserting Strategies in Node.js** project! This repository contains two main components: a simple Express server and a stress-testing module. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and test various strategies for inserting data into a database efficiently using Node.js, exploring methods that ensure performance and scalability.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following folders:

1. **simple-express-server**: A basic Express.js and PostgresSQL server designed to handle HTTP requests for data insertion. This module is set up to run in a Docker container, making deployment and testing easy across different environments.
   
2. **stress-test**: This module includes scripts and configurations for stress-testing the Express server. It provides tools to measure and analyze performance under different load conditions, ensuring that our insertion strategies are optimized.

Each folder includes its own `README.md` with more specific information on setup, configuration, and usage.
